## Data Module
 Welcome to the Data Module of ProductLab. You're first assignment was provided via word doc. But now that you've been introduced to Github the rest of your assignments will be found here. This week you'll be covering a cornerstone of software development: data. We will start with Data Structures, which will give you an idea of how your computer stores and manipulates data. Then we will move on cover to databases and data modelling, or in other words, how your applications reference and manipulate data. 

 ## Housekeeping
 Your projects this week will be on Kahn Academy, Udemy and MongoDB.com. To keep a central record of your accomplishments you will need to create a repository called 'Data_Module_yourname' and then upload each project to the repository. This will allow your instructors to easily review your work! Your final project will also link to this repo to demonstrate your Data skillset. 

 This repo will serve as both your solution files as well as the rubric for how you should name and structure your files. 

 ## Assignments: Academic 
 Before working on the hands on material dive into the following: 

1. [An Intro into Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-common-data-structures-and-algorithms) 
    * This is as deep as we will go with data structures, they are primarily an academic aspect of computer science. But they have real world implications that are important to understand. You can't claim to be technical if you don't know what this stuff is! 
    * Make sure you follow the instructions on the Odin Project page and click through and review the material in the links. However, do not go farther than this (Common Data Structures and Algorithms) page. If you see the Linked-List project you've gone too far 

2. [Relational vs Non-Relational Databases](https://www.mongodb.com/compare/relational-vs-non-relational-databases)
    * Now we'll move on from data structures to something more applicable to real world problems you'll face. Relational vs Non-relational databases have unique strengths and weaknesses that will be important to understand when making product decisions. Follow along with this article closely, it will come up with your clients. 

## Assignments: Hands On
Enough reading! Time to make some stuff! 

1. [An introduction to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/sql-basics/v/welcome-to-sql)
    * Kahn Academy has great material to get you started on SQL. This tutorial has videos as well as hands-on problems to learn from. 
    * A few notes on how to use this website
        * During a SQL tutorial video if you want to try it out yourself hit the "Spin-off" button. Which will open up a sandbox for you to type in SQL queries yourself and follow along with the video! 
            * a sandbox is jargon for a contained and pre-setup environment. So all you have to worry about is learning SQL queries rather than worrying about how to set up an SQL database. 
        * Click through the "About", "Documentation" and "Spin-offs" under the video for helpful tips as well as other students solutions
    * Assigned sections: 
        1. Lesson 1: SQL Basics
        2. Lesson 2: More advanced SQL queries
        3. Lesson 3: Relational queries in SQL
    * **Required work to be uploaded to your github repository:** 
        1. Project: Design a store database
        2. Project: Data dig
            * note: for this project you'll either need build your own dataset within the sandbox OR 
                1. navigate to one of the linked data sets
                2. then copy paste the queries into the Kahn Academy sandbox 
                3. THEN write your queries to answer the questions in the project
        3. Project: Famous people

2. [Business Analysis and Data Modelling](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/business-analysis-data-modelling/)
    * Parts of this Udemy course are dry, however, all of it is extremely applicable to projects you may be on. Follow along with this course and complete the final project. 
    * Assigned sections: 
        * all sections assigned. Note: we recommend you change the viewing speed to 1.5x or 2x
    * **Required work to be uploaded to your github repository:**
        1. Assigment 2: Data Modelling - Relationships & Optionality

## Assignments: Challenge
If you have additional time or you want to come back to later to enhance your final project, feel free to tackle this challenge project! 

1. [An introduction to building with MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/)
    * You worked with relational databases while learning SQL. Now you have the opportunity to build and query a non-relational database. This project is doable and will help you understand what a developer experiences when working with non-relational databases like MongoDB. 

## Assignment Format 
At the end of the week we expect your Github repo to have the following files: 

1. store_db_yourname.sql
2. data_dig_yourname.sql 
3. famous_people_yourname.sql
4. library_data_model_yourname.pdf/doc
    * the file type for this project does not matter, use whatever you prefer 

## Troubleshooting

If you have any trouble navigating the GitHub repo or working on the exercises, please don't hesitate to ask for help. We have a team of mentors who are happy to assist you.
